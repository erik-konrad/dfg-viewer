DFG Viewer
==========

The DFG Viewer is a browser web service for displaying digitized books from
remote library repositories. It has an OAI-PMH interface for exchanging meta-
and structural data in the METS/MODS and METS/TEI formats.

As a result, users are provided with a uniform interface for viewing digitized
media. They can browse documents, view and download the individual digital
representations in various resolutions and use further options if the library
provides additional data.


About the DFG Viewer
--------------------

The DFG Viewer is based on the free CMS TYPO3 and the Digital Library Framework
of Kitodo.Presentation. It is open source software itself and can be used free of
charge by anyone interested. This can either be done via the web service
operated by the Saxon State and University Library Dresden or by means of a
local implementation. You can find comprehensive documentations, examples and
useful tips regarding both application scenarios at the project's home page.
The development of the DFG Viewer is predominantly funded by the German Research
Foundation (DFG, http://www.dfg.de/en/).
